# Hey there! 👋 I'm Pedram


I wander between numbers and code. By day, a math student trying to make sense of the universe;  
by night, a software engineer chasing bugs and building apps.  

I speak **Flutter**, **C++**, and **Python** fluently,  
and I have a weakness for music, books, and long walks that clear the mind.  

💡 I believe in solving problems, creating things that matter,  
and learning something new every single day.

## 🚀 Current Mission
Turning ideas into apps, one line of code at a time.  
Sometimes fueled by coffee, sometimes by sheer stubbornness.  

---

## 🎯 Fun Facts
- Permanent state: tired but coding 😅  
- Life motto: "If it compiles, it's worth celebrating!"  
- Favorite debugging method: stare at the screen until it works
